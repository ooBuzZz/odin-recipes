        <li>4 chicken thighs, bone-in and skin-on</li>
        <li>4 chicken drumsticks</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: In a large bowl, combine buttermilk, minced garlic, salt, black pepper, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper (if using). Add the chicken pieces, ensuring they are well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.</li>
        <li>Step 2: In a shallow dish, place the flour. Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing excess to drip off. Dredge each piece in the flour, pressing lightly to ensure an even coating.</li>
        <li>Step 3: In a large skillet or deep fryer, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350째F (175째C).</li>
        <li>Step 4: Carefully add the coated chicken pieces to the hot oil, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding. Fry for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through (internal temperature should reach 165째F or 74째C).</li>
        <li>Step 5: Remove the fried chicken from the oil and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Step 6: Serve the garlic fried chicken hot, garnished with additional minced garlic or herbs if desired. Enjoy with your favorite sides like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or a fresh salad!</li>
